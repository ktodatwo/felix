# felix

Felix is a microblogging site (think 280 characters or less) for people named Felix built using Python Flask on the backend and BootStrap CSS on the front. 

This ongoing project is based on the web development techniques laid out in "Flask Web Development: Developing Web Applications with Python" by Miguel Grinberg.
